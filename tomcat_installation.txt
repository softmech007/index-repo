TOMCAT APACHE:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apache Tomcat is a web server for Java server-side applications. It is a Servlet/JSP container and implements several Java EE specifications. 

Steps to follow for the installation and configuration of TOMCAT APACHE in RHEL/CentOS:

1.  Login as root in server and configure yum local repo if not already configured. 

2. Install tomcat package from repository by yum command.
# yum install tomcat

3. Edit tomcat.conf file and append below line there by using vi editor.
# vim /usr/share/tomcat/conf/tomcat.conf

JAVA_OPTS="-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx1026m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC"

4. Install all other tomcat packages like tomcat webapps, tomcat docs etc.
# yum install tomcat*

5. Edit tomcat-user.xml file and write below (use less than symbol before starting this line and greater than symbol after) line there in tomcat-users section by vi editor, save it.
# vim /usr/share/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml
user username="admin" password="password" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui"/

6. Start tomcat service now.
# systemctl start tomcat

7. Set tomcat service to start automatically after reboot.
# systemctl enable tomcat

8. Add port 8080 (to be used by tomcat) in firewall.
# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp

9. Reload the firewall.
# firewall-cmd --reload

Now Test your configuration:
Open Firefox and write below line in address bar.
localhost:8080
or
Open any browser and write below line in address bar.
ip-address:8080
(where ip-address is the IP address of your tomcat server)

You should see a webpage showing successful configuration of Tomcat Apache.

You have successfully installed and configured Tomcat Apache in Linux.
